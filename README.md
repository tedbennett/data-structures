## data-structures

### Description
My implementations of the data structures described in *Data Structures and Algorithms in Python* by Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser. After reading the textbook, I decided to have a go at implementing the structures based only on their description and the necessary functionality.

### Stack
A stack supports push(item), pop(), top(), is_empty() and len() member functions. It's implemented as a Python array.
